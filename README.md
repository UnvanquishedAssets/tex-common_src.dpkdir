===================================


About
-----

This is a texture set providing common materials to the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project, for example caulk, clip, portal and hint surfaces, nobuild and trigger content materials, etc.

This texture set is a work in progress by various authors for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

This texture set is meant to be used with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net/) for more information about the game itself.
